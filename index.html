        <p>I went to Iran, doing research for my thesis and my book, interviewing underground fashion designers and asking them about their work. But, at the end I said, "Now that I've taken up like five hours of your day, what can I do for you?" And across the board, all of them were like, "We know your work, we know what you do, but at the end of the day, there's nothing that really just celebrates Iranian culture for what it is. And not in a way that's just catered toward white people or catered to Americans &emsp;just to uplift our work and celebrate. 'So, my book documenting underground street style in Iran, showing the beauty and creativity of what's happening, and that in and of itself being a form of resistancee, is now where my work is."</p>
